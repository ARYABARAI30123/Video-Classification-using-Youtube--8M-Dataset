# YouTube 8M Dataset Video Classification

##  Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify videos using the **YouTube-8M dataset**, a large-scale labeled dataset of YouTube video IDs with high-quality machine-generated annotations. The aim is to analyze video metadata and embeddings to predict video categories effectively.

##  Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into video metadata, embeddings, and label distribution.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction of video embeddings.
- **Model Training:** Training deep learning models (VIT transformer)to classify videos.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing results with graphs and plots for a better understanding of model performance.

##  Dataset
The **YouTube 8M** dataset consists of 8 million YouTube video IDs with associated labels across 4800 different categories. The dataset is provided by Google, and it includes video embeddings generated from raw video frames.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch** (for building deep learning models)  
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for model evaluation)
